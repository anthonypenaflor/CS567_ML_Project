"You might think, therefore, that the crash in the price of oil must be dealing a potentially fatal blow to renewable power.
An illustration from recent history seems to back that up.
When the oil price spiked in the 1970s, the then US president Jimmy Carter had solar panels fixed to the White House roof, only to see his successor Ronald Reagan rip them off when the oil price tumbled.
Fast forward to the past few months and at first sight a similar effect appears to be happening as the share prices of many renewable energy companies take a hit.
However, things are not so straightforward. The world of energy has changed.
For a start, oil does not compete with wind or solar power. They perform different roles - oil is still dominant in transport while renewables generate electricity.
Since the 1970s, the use of oil at power stations has dwindled. It was replaced by gas, which was seen as a cleaner and more secure option with supplies less vulnerable to international crises.

The dopamine neurons are active when the brain expects a reward, and they are less active when the reward is withheld.
The researchers found that the dopamine neurons were more active when the rats",1,rats that were anticipating a reward were released the chemical dynorphin. The researchers said it was the first time a chemical associated with pleasure had been linked to the anticipation of a reward. the researchers said it could be used in the future to help people with addictions.

"Patients with ulcerative colitis often have to rely on medicine given by enema, but this can be uncomfortable, messy and inconvenient.
Now a US team has developed a hydrogel that attaches to ulcers and slowly releases a drug to help treat them.
The early findings are reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Ulcerative colitis is the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease and mainly affects young people.
It causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon.
Symptoms include:
Medicines taken orally are often broken down before they reach the affected area.
Delivering the drug more directly through an enema - which has to be done regularly - can also be difficult and inconvenient for patients.
To overcome this problem, US researchers took a gel called ascorbyl palmitate, which is safe and already approved for use in humans.
In tests in mice and on bowel tissue from patients with the disease, the gel was shown to selectively attach to areas of inflammation.

"The research was carried out for the Assembly's enterprise committee.
The committee asked Open University economist Leslie Budd to assess the potential impacts of a British exit from the European Union, so-called the 'Brexit'.
Dr Budd said economic output in Northern Ireland could be 3% lower as a result.
The most recent figures suggests the output of the Northern Ireland economy is £33bn a year.
A 3% fall would knock almost £1bn off that.
Dr Budd cautioned that estimating the economic consequences of 'Brexit' was complex and that making an assessment at a Northern Ireland level was even more challenging.
However, he said that transaction costs for cross border trade could ""rise significantly"" and ""act as a disincentive"" to economic co-operation.
He added that Northern Ireland would also become a less attractive location for emerging market companies which are looking for an entry route to EU markets.
Taken together, those two factors would undermine the logic of ""harmonising corporation tax"" with the Republic of Ireland.

It found common distributions of stations within the networks, as well as common proportions of the numbers of lines, stations, and total distances.
In some senses, it is unsurprising that the study found that networks tended over time to comprise a dense core of central stations with a number of lines radiating outward from it.
By choosing the world's largest networks, from Beijing to Barcelona, the results were bound to represent networks that serve city centres with a dense collection of stations and bring commuters inward from more distant stations.
But the analysis shows a number of less obvious similarities across all 14 networks.
It found the total number of stations was proportional to the square of the number of lines - that is, a four-fold increase in station number would result in a doubling of the number of lines.
The dense core of central stations all had the same average number of neighbours in the network, and in all cases, about half the total number of stations were found outside the core.
In addition, the length of any one branch from the core's centre was about the same as twice the diameter of the core.

"A study, reported in the journal Science, has now shown that eels can use their electric organs to remotely control the fish they hunt.
A group of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego, have been studying the electric eel for several years.
They have found that the eel is able to remotely control the behaviour of other fish by using its electric organs.
The eel’s electric organs can produce a current of up to 650 volts, which is strong enough to stun prey. The eel then uses its electric organs to remotely direct the stunned prey to a place where it can be eaten.
This is the first time that the electric eel has been shown to be able to remotely control the behaviour of other fish. The scientists believe that this ability could be used to develop new types of remote control devices, such as robotic fish.

It follows a suspected drone strike on a US Navy helicopter in 2017, which led to an investigation by the US Navy.

He said the exact terms of the policy were classified.
The move comes days after the US Army ordered its own troops to stop using drones made by Chinese manufacturer DJI because of alleged ""cyber-vulnerabilities"".
It became illegal to fly personal drones within 400ft (122m) of the US's 133 military facilities in April.
The Federal Aviation Administration announced at the time that those who disobeyed the order would face financial penalties and possible criminal charges.

There have already been incidents in which members of the public have shot down drones flying over their own properties.
And the new guidance is intended to clarify what steps military bases can take, and warn local communities of the potential counter-measures.

"Researchers examined the aftermath of same-sex sporting events and found that men spent longer talking, touching or embracing their opponents than women.
These efforts to patch up differences between competitors are known as “self-other merging,” and are thought to be a way to bond with rivals after a hard-fought contest. In heterosexual competitions, this merging is often sexualised, with winners and losers trying to get close to the opposite sex.
In the new study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers found that, for men, the same-sex nature of the event appeared to lead them to focus on the physical aspects of the contest, and to attempt to bond with their opponents in a more overtly sexual way.
“Men, in general, are more likely to engage in self-other merging after competition,” said lead author, Dr Nicholas Rule of the University of Toronto.

While the notion of homosexuality is not widely understood or accepted in this deeply traditional Caucasus nation, most Georgians were appalled by the scenes that unfolded in Tbilisi on 17 May.
And yet, what happened clearly illustrates the importance of the Church in Georgia.
Georgia was an early adopter of Christianity making it a state religion in 337AD. Georgians maintained their faith over the centuries despite the waves of invading hordes, including the armies of Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane.
Although the Soviets permitted religion to be practised, its reach was severely limited. In 1917, there were 2,455 working churches in Georgia, but by the mid-1980s there were only 80, along with a few monasteries and a seminary.

Many scientists believe the crater was created by an asteroid or comet 10km wide that struck the Earth 66 million years ago.

But a new study suggests the impactor was only about 5km wide, and that the crater was formed by a series of smaller, more powerful explosions.
The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests the asteroid or comet broke up during its fall into the Earth’s atmosphere, with each fragment creating a separate crater in the process.
The researchers used a computer model to re-create the cratering process.

For most of us, the thought of a detention conjures up images of a grumpy teacher or headmaster forcing us to sit in a classroom on our own and do homework. But for some, it's a chance to learn new skills.
The 'detention' was a three-hour session at a community centre in the north of England, where a group of 10-15-year-olds were learning how to make a film.

The aim was to teach them new skills that would help them get back into mainstream education.

"A study, reported in the journal Science, has now shown that eels can use their electric organs to remotely control the fish they hunt.
A researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, found that the electric discharges from eels made the muscles of their prey twitch.
This makes the fish easier to capture either by immobilising it or making it ""jump"" to show where it's hiding.
Kenneth Catania, who led the study, set up small aquatic arenas to test the eels' hunting abilities - putting an eel and an unfortunate fish into the same tank.
When they spotted their prey, the eels released pulses of electricity that appeared to immobilise the fish.
Further study revealed that the eels' electric pulses directly activated the nerves that controlled their prey's muscles.
""When the eel's pulses slow down - when the eel gets tired at the end of its attack - you see individual fish twitches, with one twitch from every pulse,"" said Dr Catania.

"Scientists plan to send the long-range autonomous vehicle under the sea-ice of the Arctic - from one side of the ocean basin to the other.
Scientists at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) are planning to send a long-range autonomous vehicle under the sea-ice of the Arctic - from one side of the ocean basin to the other.
The vehicle will be equipped with a range of sensors to investigate the ocean’s role in the Earth’s climate system, and in particular to look at the role of Arctic sea ice in the global climate.
Arctic sea ice is a crucial part of the Earth’s climate system. It is an insulating blanket that protects the ocean from the atmosphere, and so plays a key role in controlling the ocean’s role in the global climate.
Sea ice also influences the surface properties of the ocean and the exchange of gases with the atmosphere, and is a key driver of ocean circulation.

The moon is our closest neighbour, and yet we still know remarkably little about its origins. It has long been thought that the moon was formed when a Mars-sized object collided with the proto-Earth, scattering debris that coalesced into the moon. But this theory has come under fire in recent years, with some researchers suggesting that the moon formed from the Earth’s mantle after the proto-Earth was struck by a smaller object.
Now, researchers have developed a new theory that combines the best of both worlds, showing how a massive impact could have created the moon’s current mass and composition. The findings, published in Science Advances, could help scientists better understand the moon’s history and formation.

"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday promoted Mr Wyatt to an aged care and indigenous health portfolio, following a government reshuffle triggered by an expenses scandal.
The reshuffle has seen several other ministers promoted, including Mr Wyatt's WA colleague, Michaelia Cash, who was elevated to the immigration and border protection portfolio.
Mr Wyatt has been accused of failing to declare $12,000 in travel expenses, as well as claiming more than $17,000 in expenses for flights between Perth and Canberra that he did not take.
He has denied any wrongdoing.
Mr Wyatt said on Wednesday he was looking forward to the new role.

Annuities provide an income for the rest of your life, however long you live. After your death some annuities pay a smaller sum to your spouse or partner. These are often called ""joint life"" annuities.
The new proposal is that you will be able to cash in your annuity for either a single lump sum or a series of payments. This has obvious advantages. Pensioners can invest it in a different way in the hope of receiving a higher income, perhaps via a buy-to-let property. Or you could pay off your mortgage, reduce other debts, help children with university fees, or even go on holiday.

Activists from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in France have lost their legal challenge to a ban on same-sex marriage.

It also said the ban did not violate the right to equality and the rights of parents and children.

A survey of more than 1,000 companies found that half were taking measures to boost the skills of their workforce in response to recruitment difficulties.
A third were looking to take on more apprentices, the survey indicated.

"What are the values that infuse it? And how did it break out of its kilted straitjacket to be shaped by the times we live in now?
If the modern Scottish identity has a birthplace, it's at Abbotsford, the country home, 40 miles south of Edinburgh, of Sir Walter Scott.
The novelist and poet, who died in 1832, designed it himself, with crow-stepped gables and Scots baronial turrets and crenellated balconies.
Scott invented modern Scotland here, summoned it from his own imagination, and served it up principally for English consumption.
Until then, Scotland had been, in the English imagination especially, a wild and lawless place that had to be subdued by force.
Scott made it safe, even romantic.

"Scientists plan to send the long-range autonomous vehicle under the sea-ice of the Arctic - from one side of the ocean basin to the other.
It is a journey of at least 2,500km - and while nuclear subs might routinely do it, the prospect is a daunting one for a battery-operated research vehicle.
The trip could happen in 2018 or 2019.
“It represents one of the last great transects on Earth for an autonomous sub,” said Prof Russell Wynn, from the National Oceanography Centre, Boaty's UK base.
“Previously, such subs have gone perhaps 150km (horizontally) under the ice and then come back out out again. Boaty will have the endurance to go all the way across the Arctic.”
Such a mission would give scientists rare insight into conditions that hold sway under the ice floes’ more persistent regions.

In court, HPE argued that although the 2012 legal judgement meant Oracle had resumed making software for the powerful chips, its business had suffered harm. It argued that Oracle took the decision in 2011 to stop supporting Itanium in a bid to get customers to move to hardware made by Sun - a hardware firm owned by Oracle.
Oracle said that its decision in 2011 was driven by a realisation that Itanium was coming to the end of its life. It also argued that the contract it signed never obliged it to keep producing software in perpetuity.

"Luckily - and this is what makes sport so attractive - logic does not always decide the outcome.
Since 1979, when the West Indies won their last title, logic has triumphed four times and there have been upsets four times.
