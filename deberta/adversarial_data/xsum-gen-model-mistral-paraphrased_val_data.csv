The Latics had a chance to make it to the FA Cup semi-finals, a chance of revenge over the club they lost to in the 2013 final, and a chance to show the rest of the Premier League what they could do.

And then Wigan went and did it.They did it without being spectacular, not scoring in open play at all, and playing second fiddle for long spells - but they did it with the kind of team spirit and togetherness that is the cornerstone of any promotion push and should not be underestimated by anyone thinking of a move to the DW Stadium to play football for a living.

The original series had long been thought lost, until the BBC’s TV and Archive team discovered a number of cans in its vaults of “The Natural World” series. They were later able to identify them as episodes of Zoo Quest – although the film was badly fading, and was in black and white, making it difficult for the BBC to edit it for television.

They then took the decision to re-shoot the episodes in colour, bringing them up to date and, hopefully, introducing the show to a new audience.

That rule will then be validated by a 1m-high barrier being tested at the test track, which each team will be expected to crash its car in.

This approach mirrors the regulations for the crash-test dummies used in F1 cars.

"A study, reported in the journal Science, has now shown that eels can use their electric organs to remotely control the fish they hunt.
A researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, found that the electric discharges from eels made the muscles of their prey twitch.

Kenneth Catania, who led the study, set up small aquatic arenas to test the eels' hunting abilities - putting an eel and an unfortunate fish into the same tank.
When they spotted their prey, the eels released pulses of electricity that appeared to immobilise the fish.
Further study revealed that the eels' electric pulses directly activated the nerves that controlled their prey's muscles.

"The exploding star was first observed back in June last year but is still radiating vast amounts of energy.
At its peak, the event, known as PS16dlv, was around 10 billion times brighter than our sun. This makes it one of the brightest transient events of the last 40 years, according to astronomers.

Now, a study published in Nature Astronomy shows that an explosion at a black hole could explain the powerful event.

The findings come after astronomers first observed the phenomenon using the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California.

Astronomers at Durham University in the UK say these observations showed the “extraordinary brightness and high velocities of the material around PS16dlv”.

These high speeds may suggest an unusual origin for the blast, which “exceeds the capabilities of conventional stellar-mass black holes,” they explained.

"Under current law, emissions must be cut by 80% by 2050 - but ministers have said this does not go far enough.

The Committee on Climate Change - which advises the Government on emissions targets - said this would be ""challenging but feasible"".

It found that under the current target, the UK economy would have to cut emissions by 6% per year on average to 2050 - more than double the average rate so far.

This would require carbon prices - such as through carbon taxes or trading schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) - to be raised to around £150 per tonne of carbon dioxide.

The committee said the target needs to go further if the UK wants to retain its credibility as a world leader in combating climate change.

The study, carried out at the University of California, has shown that children with autism who are about to run away experience a heightened sense of threat and distress from others, making them more sensitive to the fear they believe they are causing. They also found the threat of criticism from others makes them feel they are being unfairly singled out.

"Nadia Savchenko appeared furious after her statement was refused, despite 90 minutes remaining of what was expected to be her last full court hearing.

Her legal team asked to speak for 10 minutes to the judges, saying Savchenko needed more time as she had never had a chance to study Russian law, and needed to study it before making the most important decision of her life.

The court said it didn’t have time to waste, however, and refused to accept the request. The legal team tried to read it anyway, but was stopped by the court and thrown out of the room.

The Ukrainian pilot has been on trial in Donetsk since March, accused of participating in the shelling of Lugansk, and then crossing into Russia, where she is believed to have become a witness against herself by giving a statement to investigators, which prosecutors used as the basis of their case.

The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to produce a stronger forecast for UK economic growth at Budget time.
BBC economics editor Robert Peston said a fall in inflation expectations generates an annual windfall for the Treasury of around £6bn.
In January UK inflation hit a record low of 0.3%, helped by oil prices.
The reduction in the squeeze on public finances is ""more or less automatic"", he said.
Low inflation means lower payments by the government on index-linked debt. It also means lower increases on certain benefits, he said.
Reduced spending on welfare means there could be more cash available for expenditure on schools, hospitals, and the police, he added.

Pensioners can invest it in a different way in the hope of receiving a higher income, perhaps via a buy-to-let property. Or you could pay off your mortgage, reduce other debts, help children with university fees, or even go on holiday.

Siobhan McLaughlin took the case with the help of the advice charity.
The judge said denying a benefit aimed at easing financial pressure on bereaved families was discrimination.
Ms McLaughlin, from County Antrim, challenged Northern Ireland's Department for Social Development's decision to refuse her both bereavement benefit and widowed parent's allowance.

Scott invented modern Scotland here, summoned it from his own imagination, and served it up principally for English consumption.
Until then, Scotland had been, in the English imagination especially, a wild and lawless place that had to be subdued by force.
Scott made it safe, even romantic.
""Scott was very clear when he wrote his first novel, Waverley, that what",0,What are the values that infuse it? What are the values that infuse it? What are the values that infuse it?

"Growing demand for groundwater is putting pressure on the resource while researchers struggle to accurately estimate the future supply.
But a team from Oxford University, UK, has developed a new groundwater forecasting technique that is a more efficient use of the resource. It uses a statistical model to estimate how much of the resource is being used, and how much is likely to be available in future.
“Groundwater supplies about half the world’s water needs,” Dr Tianyi Huang, an environmental fluid mechanicist in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science, said in a statement.

> In dry periods, demand for groundwater increases and the levels become more depleted. In those circumstances, the water levels become lower and lower, so people start extracting at an increased rate which accelerates the decrease in the water levels. This causes a vicious cycle that leads to increased groundwater use and over-extraction in the long term.

"This is according to researchers from Duke University in the US, who developed decision-making games that the apes played to earn edible treats.

The scientists gave the animals the opportunity to earn the food by trading off rewards in terms of their time: in one scenario they had to choose a treat, which could be larger, but only after a delay.

The scientists studied two groups of capuchin monkeys, aged five to 15, at Duke’s Yerkes Primate Center over the course of two years and found that those that had more experience playing the game in pairs made better decisions.

These more experienced capuchins preferred the quick-but-smaller reward, and also tended to choose more frequently when there was a high chance of winning. They also chose to stick with familiar options when their original reward was taken away.
