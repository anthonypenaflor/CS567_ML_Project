# CS567 Machine Learning Final Project

## Overview
This repository has multiple examples of machine learning models being trained on datasets to detect AI-generated text. 
This project was based off the Kaggle Detect AI-Generated Text competition where we expanded to generate our own datasets,
built, trained, and tested our models against our newly generated datasets. We also added a level of complexity by generating
adversarial attacks to test model robustness.
